# Portfolio

A portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages, containing my personal projects, showcasing my learnings, skills, and capabilities as an IT.

This repository was initially created as a subject requirement for my COMP-016 Web Development course during the first semester of my junior year as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at The Polytechnic University of The Philippines, wherein I was given the objective below:

    Apply HTML and CSS layout techniques (Box Model, Flexbox, and Grid) in designing a personal portfolio website, and to learn how to publish a website using GitHub Pages.
